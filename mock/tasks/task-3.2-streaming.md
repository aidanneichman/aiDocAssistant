# Task 3.2: Streaming Response Handler

## Objective
Implement streaming response processing for real-time token delivery to frontend via Server-Sent Events.

## Files to Create
- `backend/app/clients/streaming_handler.py` - Streaming response processing
- `backend/app/utils/sse_utils.py` - Server-Sent Events utilities

## Streaming Handler Features
- Process async streaming responses from model client
- Format tokens for SSE transmission
- Handle connection errors and reconnection
- Buffer management for efficient streaming
- Error propagation during streaming

## SSE Utilities
- Format SSE messages with proper event types
- Handle connection keepalive
- Manage client disconnections
- Event types: `token`, `error`, `done`

## SSE Message Format
```
data: {"type": "token", "content": "Hello"}

data: {"type": "error", "message": "Connection failed"}

data: {"type": "done", "message": "Stream complete"}
```

## Streaming Flow
1. Client sends chat request
2. Backend starts model streaming
3. Tokens streamed via SSE to frontend
4. Frontend displays tokens in real-time
5. Stream ends with completion signal

## Success Criteria
- Smooth real-time token streaming
- Proper SSE formatting and event handling
- Connection error recovery
- Clean stream termination
- Frontend can consume stream easily

## Tests
- `tests/unit/test_streaming.py`
  - Test SSE message formatting
  - Test streaming handler with mock responses
  - Test error handling during streaming
  - Test connection management
  - Test stream completion signals
