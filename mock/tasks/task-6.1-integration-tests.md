# Task 6.1: Integration Tests

## Objective
Create comprehensive end-to-end integration tests covering complete user workflows and system interactions.

## Files to Create
- `tests/integration/test_upload_flow.py` - End-to-end upload testing
- `tests/integration/test_chat_flow.py` - End-to-end chat testing
- `tests/integration/test_streaming.py` - Streaming integration tests
- `tests/integration/conftest.py` - Integration test fixtures
- `tests/integration/helpers.py` - Test utility functions

## Upload Flow Tests
- Complete document upload workflow
- File validation and error scenarios
- Multiple document handling
- Storage verification
- Metadata persistence
- Error recovery scenarios

## Chat Flow Tests
- Session creation and management
- Message sending and receiving
- Document context integration
- Mode switching behavior
- Session persistence across requests
- Error handling in chat flow

## Streaming Tests
- SSE connection establishment
- Token streaming functionality
- Connection error recovery
- Stream completion handling
- Multiple concurrent streams
- Client disconnection scenarios

## Test Infrastructure
- Test database/storage setup
- Mock OpenAI API responses
- Temporary file handling
- Test data factories
- Cleanup procedures
- Performance benchmarks

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path Tests
- Upload document → Start chat → Send message → Receive response
- Multiple documents → Deep research mode → Streaming response
- Session persistence → Resume chat → Continue conversation

### Error Scenarios
- Invalid file upload attempts
- Network failures during streaming
- OpenAI API errors
- Storage failures
- Concurrent access conflicts

### Performance Tests
- Large file upload handling
- Multiple concurrent users
- Long-running chat sessions
- Memory usage monitoring
- Response time measurements

## Success Criteria
- All integration tests pass consistently
- Error scenarios handled gracefully
- Performance within acceptable limits
- Test coverage of critical paths
- Reliable test execution
- Clear test failure reporting

## Tests
- Complete end-to-end workflow validation
- Error scenario coverage
- Performance and load testing
- Concurrent user simulation
- Data integrity verification
